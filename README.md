# The prediction whether or not a passenger survived on Titanic
### The task is to predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the Synthanic (a much larger synthetic dataset based on the actual Titanic dataset). For each PasengerId line in the test set, we must predict a value of 0 or 1 for the Survived target.
