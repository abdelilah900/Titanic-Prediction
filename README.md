# The prediction whether or not a passenger survived on Titanic
### The task is to predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the Synthanic (a synthetic, much larger dataset based on the actual Titanic dataset). For each PasengerId row in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived target.
